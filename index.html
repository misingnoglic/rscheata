Hi everyone! Welcome to the former home of rscheata.net.

This website used to be a cheating website for RuneScape, where two brothers Mark and Eric Snellman created the iBot software for botting on RuneScape.

After a long and hard lawsuit, Mark and Eric were forced to shut down the website and hand the domain to Jagex. Somehow Jagex has failed to renew the domain, and so it has come in my hands.

This website is very important to me - it was where I spent many afternoons and weekends making friends and learning how to code. This website is what inspired me to learn code and eventually go to school for computer science. I also made many amazing friends here.

In a bit, I'll add some screenshots of my memories here.
